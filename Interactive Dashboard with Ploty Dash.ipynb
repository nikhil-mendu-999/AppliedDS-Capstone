You will be guided to build this dashboard application via the following tasks:\n\n- TASK 1: Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component\n- TASK 2: Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown\n- TASK 3: Add a Range Slider to Select Payload\n- TASK 4: Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot\n\nAfter visual analysis using the dashboard, you should be able to obtain some insights to answer the following five questions:\n\n1. Which site has the largest successful launches?\n2. Which site has the highest launch success rate?\n3. Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate?\n4. Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate?\n5. Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest launch success rate?"
